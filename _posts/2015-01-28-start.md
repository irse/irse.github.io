I've tried Posterous, Posthaven, Medium, Ghost (Pro and self-hosted), Blogger, Silvrback, Postagon, Tumblr, Squarespace and WordPress (.com and .org) - and a horrible one called EScenic - but no blogging platform has everything I need in a blogging platform. Let me break it down for you.

WordPress was my first choice like it has been for almost everyone for the last decade (I used another platform called Xanga before that, but I can't recall what happened to it around 2005). For the first few years, I wasn't very familiar with its features - I would only log in, add a new post, fill out the tages, categories and other text fields, and hit 'Publish'. Slowly, however, I became aware of all the other bells and whistles that were available. It felt like all aspects of my blog were under my control. That felt good.

In the next five or so years, I became familiar with everything about WordPress.com - and I mean _everything_. Then, in 2011, I graduated, got a salaried job and thus some money to spend discovering new blogging solutions. At the same time, I was also becoming aware of WordPress's shortcomings. They can be broadly classified into two kinds.

1. The sheer number of options leads only to a [paradox of choice](http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice?language=en).
2. Not all that WordPress offered was needed for a blog to be a full-fledged blog. Especially as the sources and channels of traffic on the web changed, site-builders started to realize that users as well as search-engines looked for a fixed (slowly changing at best) set of items on sites. WordPress offered all of them and much more.

A self-hosted WordPress didn't change anything - in fact, it demanded more of my attention. Now, I had to both find my way around WordPress as well as manage the domain and hosting.

One of the first alternatives I chanced upon was Posterous. It was simple - as advertised - and provided a UX that, to me, was drastically different from WordPress because it accomplished just as much with fewer frills and flutters. Unfortunately, it was shut down by Twitter in 2012. If it was still up, I'd probably be using it right now.

Its successor, Posthaven, offers a similar UX. Its founders - also Posterous's founders - promise never to be acquired either, and levy a fee of $5/mo to keep things running. That's good: paying up means I'm allowed to have expectations, and expect them to be met, too. Its content-creation page is so minimal yet relatively powerful that it's next only to Medium. Why am I not on it now? Because the pace of development on it is very slow and it still lacks many basic features, especially CSS-theming.

Before I go on, let me get Medium as quickly out of the way as it got out of my life: you can't brand a Medium 'blog' the way you want it, you can't set up a domain for it, and you don't have access to good analytics.

Anyway, next in line were the two ol' faithfuls, Blogger and Tumblr. Blogger, as everyone knows, hasn't been anywhere on the top of Google's priorities in the last... well, many years. It offers a roster of basic design templates apart from a few more dynamic options that were introduced around 2011-2012. Although there have been no signs that Google might have wanted to shut Blogger down, there also appear to be equally few reasons for it to be kept alive<sup>*</sup>. And Tumblr on the other hand seems to be the place only for fans of ASoIaF and cats.

Next in line was Silvrback, which at $30/yr was a frikkin' steal. It also had a Markdown post-editor that resembled Medium's editor. Then again, it shared a few nagging issues with the other platforms. The sole developer working on it, Damien Sowers, hadn't been quick with certain updates. CSS-theming wasn't available. Most importantly - and this could be just me - it has no perceptible community of users who interact on any fora on Silvrback. Using it feels like using a public restroom: go in, do your thing, walk back out. You might say the writing is all that should concern me (as a journalist) but I've come to expect more from blogging platforms, especially if you can't think of a reaosn why such a service wouldn't leverage its community to grow. In much the same vein, Postagon is also ruled out.

That brings me to the last, and most promising, candidate: Ghost.

Ghost has it all: minimalism, Markdown-editing, theming, branding, a community of developers, and a community of users. And unlike WordPress, it has a centralized marketplace, and integration with Disqus and Google Analytics instead of wasting time on commenting and site-metrics respectively. Self-hosting Ghost has become very easy, too: hosting providers like Digital Ocean and GCE (with Bitnami) let you do it at the click of a few buttons and at as little as $5/mo. Its 'Pro' offering is also worth it at $10/mo.

So why am I not on Ghost right now? I'm not sure...

And why am I on GitHub Pages right now? Because I thought I'd give it a shot. Nothing to dislike yet. :)
