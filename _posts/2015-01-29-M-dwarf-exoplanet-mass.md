title: What kind of planets have been found around M-dwarf stars?
published: false

Fair warning: I'm not sure if the following has a point. It's just information I find interesting.

News broke yesterday that astronomers had found a star system 11 billion light-years away with five Earth-sized planets with an M-dwarf at the center. These are both interesting details as far as the search for exoplanets is concerned. First, until this discovery, no star system had been found to harbor as many as five Earth-sized planets, only fewer or none at all. Super-Earths and gas-giants have been found to be far more common. Second, most systems of exoplanets have been found to be hosted by M-dwarf stars. A galactic survey also found that every M-dwarf in the Milky Way hosts at least one exoplanet each. To astronomers, therefore, this discovery means systems with Earth-sized planets as well as M-dwarfs with exoplanets are not recent occurrences.

With the rising significance of M-dwarf stars, then, I wanted to know: What _kind_ of planets have been found around M-dwarfs? The Exoplanet Archive does not prominently list exoplanets found to date by stellar type and as a result such a classification is not apparent. So to access the data I had help from Rachel Akeson from the [Infrared Processing and Analysis Center](http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, who told me that I could look by 'Stellar type' and filter for luminosities between 6 and 7. The results are almost all M-dwarfs. I downloaded the data and plotted them on Tableau.
